## Plan
- Creating a CNN trained on the different identifiable   types of palmer-flexion-creases 
- System to process images taken is automated. 
- A hopefully accurate feedback system.

## Future Goals

The future of this project will be a fully fleshed out application that is availble to the average individual.
