## Palmer-Flexion-Tool

A small scale machine learning tool, with the intention fo being able to trace key identifies to certain genetics through scanning the flexion crease patterns.

## Plan
- Creating a CNN trained on the different identifiable   types of palmer-flexion-creases 
- System to process images taken is automated. 
- A hopefully accurate feedback system.

## Future Goals

The future of this project would be to develop a mobile app. I originally wanted INSTRUCT to be a mobile app but that ended up not being what I wanted to learn at the time. I will most likely be using React Native framework for this mobile app. The timeline for starting this will be October 2025.

### AI Disclaimer  
This project, Palmer-Flexion-Tool, was created as a learning exercise. AI assistance from the app Cursor was used only for:  

- Guidance on structuring content  
- Checking for errors  
- Providing draft text for review  

All AI-generated drafts were fully rewritten by me. No ideas, features, or original concepts in this project originated from AI. The use of AI was limited to improving my understanding and refining my own work.
